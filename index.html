<h1>MAS.500 - How to build software - taught but Rahul Bhargava</h1>

<p>Homework for this class is being stored in this <a href="https://github.com/copplestone/mas_500">Github repository.</a></p>

<h3>Lecture 1 - Intro and basics</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Assembly code is made up of ~ 200 instructions (ADD, LD, STR), more complex instructions can carry out parallel computations (based on the GPU)</li>
	<li>Assembly code instructions can fetch values from the memory and put them in registers</li>
  <li>Different languages compile in different ways - check how python and javascript differ... https://blog.glyphobet.net/essay/2557/</li>
  <li><b>Imperative code</b> doesn't scale well</li>
  <li><b>Procedural code</b> uses functions/procedures to separate things</li>
  <li><b>Object oriented</b> - encapsulate complexity via abstraction to prevent spagetti code, enabled using classes, in Python, classes are defined by a module. The class describes the object</li>
  <li>In a Python class setup using <code>def __init__(self, filemane): self.filename = filename</code> to get all the functions with self to keep track of the file name</li>
  <li>The most important audience of your code is your future self in 6 months time</li>
  <li><b>Event driven</b> code limits the scope to reduce complexity - almost always runs around and around a loop - <code>while True:</code></li>
  <li><b>Functional programming</b> - takes an input that goes through a function and produces an output - makes it easier to scale reliably. <code>names = [line.split(",")[1] for line in all_lines] - Scala is a functional programming language so doesn't let you hold onto state</code></li>
  <li>The packages required in a python project are stored in requirements.txt so use <code>pip install requirements.txt</code></li>
  <li>Use a <b>virtual environment</b> to store the current libraries at that time and run the project inside of. To run separate OS's then you use <b>containers</b> and to control the hardware that the stuff actually runs on then you use <b>virtual machines</b>.</li>
  <li><b>API</b> - An Application Programming Interface requires a key and user ID. Some of them have a python client. We'll be using Mediacloud as an example</li>

  <li>Questions - Is object-oriented enabled by class structures, how does the functional example not hold onto state (what is the state in imperative)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lecture 2 - Building software strategically</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unit test - critcal test for the most used components and all the edge cases that they may undergo</li>
  <li><b>Data structures</b> - Stack (First In First Out), queue (Last in First Out)</li>
  <li><b>Logging</b> - way to figure out when something breaks and what happened when it broke, you can use Sentry for displaying logs created with the logging module in Python</li> 
  <li>Data for services logging, analytics, server storage all go through HTTP, encoded in json.</li>
  <li><b>Licenses</b> - the MIT license is a general open source license that people use, it doesn't have to be a project in MIT. You apply a license by including a LICENSE file in the repository.</li>
  <li>Majority of IDE's these days are specialised versions of Eclipse. IDE's are good for debugging tool and linting (enforcing norms for good code)</li>
  <li>Some architectures like Rail and iOS bake in <b>MVC (Model, View, Controller)</b> as the file names. You can have thick models (that contain all the business logic) and thin controllers, or thin models and thick controllers.</li>
  <li>When logging you can adjust the logger level. At the DEBUG logger level you get more details. Levels of logs include <code>info</code>, <code>debug</code>, <code>warn</code> and <code>error</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Lecture 3 - Building for the web</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Approaches - Content Management Systems - CMS (Wordpress, Drupal), micro-frameworks (Sinatra - Ruby, Flask - Python), macro-frameworks (Rails - Ruby, Django - Python, metero - JS) </li>
  <li>Traditionally the software stack of a web app is - server (Flask/backend) > HTML > CSS > JS. Over time, more functionality is moving to the front end into JS. </li>
  <li>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React lets you do HTML where you're doing you're JS (and sometimes the CSS too).</li>
  <li>You can get React apps up and running quickly by using create-react-app with <code>npm install -g create-react-app</code>. You can then set up a single page application using <code>create-react-app my-app</code>, <code>cd my-app</code> and <code>npm start</code>.
  <li>Redux is how a react app talks to the server</li>
  <li>You use HTTP 'get' to fetch things from a server and the server gives back using 'put' or some other relevant
    verb.</li>
  <li>Use tool in Chrome Inspect/Network/Slow 3G to experience your app with a simulated slow network. This doesn't represent latency as a result of outdated hardware. Also apps that use websockets (such as Google docs) don't get slowed down by this tool.</li>
  <li>There's a big reaction to the extensively gimicky web designs that throw as much click bait as you as possible.
    This reaction is demonstrated at <a href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/">http://brutalistwebsites.com/</a> and <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/</a>.</li>
  <li>Progressive web apps cache files previously loaded from the server so when you revisit the site you only need
    to make an API call.</li>
  <li>So Facebook has a list of templates (profile_template, newsfeed_template) which are stored on a server. And so
    the user gets a template which is seeded with data from the Facebook database. Increasingly, the templates are stored as raw files in the browser cache. And then the user only has to make a single call through an API to a database stored on a separate server.</li>
  <li>All this adds up to metrics including time to load a website which is a function of a data call through an API to a database on a server.</li>
  <li>When you want to spin up a quick server to host a web app then Heroku is best (build on top of AWS). Amazon Web
    Services (AWS) is a collection of cloud-computing services. The service that best matches Heroku is AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</li>
  <li>Flask uses decorators such as <code>@app.route("/")</code> to specify code for tasks and templates to use for
    different URLs. Templates in Flask are written using Jinja2. Jinja2 is a full featured template engine for Python. React uses routes.js to specify where to go for each URL.</li>
  <li>Redux provides a state container for JavaScript applications that will help your applications behave
    consistently.</li>
  <li>Questions - Don't understand the file structure for React, using the date html field and converting this to
    date time without having to pull out characters of the string, how are you meant to interpret the links in the API documentation</li>
  
</ul>
<h3>Intro to WebGL and shader programs to use the GPU for computation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In WebGL, the GPU is used to receiving images which it can render for the user. Shader programs repurpose the GPU to carry out arbitrary mathematical calculations.</li>
  <li>A WebGL context is instantiated within a canvas.</li>
  <li>Shader code is usually kept in script tags in the head of an HTML file. Amanda puts most of her code in <code>2d-fragment-shader</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/files/webgl/webgl-reference-card-1_0.pdf">This reference card</a> has lots of information about how to use WebGL.</li>
  <li>Information for each pixel is stored in the r, b, g and/or a value for that pixel.</li>
  <li>The most advanced form of Amanda's projects that utilize the GPU separate out the calculations for rendering from the mathematical functions.</li>
  <li>Nice web design kit is Bootstrap and FlatUI. Bootstrap modals are good for help boxes and JQuery is helpful too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lecture 4 - Building mobile applications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Current state of mobile apps is that they minimise the number of tasks per app. Facebook divides messaging into a separate app.</li>
  <li>Be aware of the types of phones, connectivity and environment that people will be using your app.</li>
  <li>There are useful design guides for the size of features like buttons and gestures that are required to make apps useable</li>
  <li>Apps are constantly stopped and started based on events like loosing connectivity or moving between different apps. Mobile apps have constrained resources</li>
  <li><b>React native</b>b> is wrapped inside many major mobile apps. Create React Mative is a bunch of command line
    options that help speed up the development cycle. Expo, Ignite and Ionic are other cross platform mobile
    development tools for building React Native apps</li>
  <li>There are several platforms to choose from including Android, iOS and Cordova. Cordova wraps your HTML/JavaScript
    app into a native container which can access the
    device functions of several platforms.</li>
  <li>Writing a requirements list in terms of expected connectivity, platforms and hardware on the phone which is
    required is really important and useful for choosing which technology you're going to use to make the app.</li>
  <li>In order to over ride UI styles nad manage complexity in Ionic you need to master Angular which can be a headache
    .</li>
</ul>
