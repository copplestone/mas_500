# HW1 - Learning how to use Mediacloud, requirements.txt and .gitignore

The research question I'm going to look into is where Hilary Clinton was referred to by her first name more that Donald Trump.

To use this project you should be able to run `pip install requirements.txt` to get all the relevant libraries (not quite working yet).

You'll also need to get a Mediacloud key and paste this into the hw1.py file.
